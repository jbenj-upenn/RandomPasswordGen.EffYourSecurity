# RandomPasswordGen.EffYourSecurity
UPenn/Trilogy Computer Coding Bootcampt: 

I created a random password generator that works utilizing javascript. The User enters a number of characters that the password will have; that value has to be between 8 and 24. 

The user then has to click on the types of characters to be used: uppercase and/or lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Finally, the user clicks on the "Generate Random Password" button at the bottom, and the password is generated next to a "clipboard" icon. Upon clicking that icon, an alert pops up to let the user know that the password has been copied to the clipboard so it can be pasted later. 

Downfall:

1. I can't seem to get the special characters to work. Dev Tools points to line 75, but I still can't figure it out.
