# RandomPasswordGen.EffYourSecurity
UPenn/Trilogy Computer Coding Bootcampt: 

Had/Have to create a random password generator using JavaScript right after my CPU died, lost all my notes, and couldn't participate in learning JavaScript the first time I was supposed to be learning it lol

I created a random password generator the wrong way my first go-around. You could press the "Generate" button, and it pumped out a password. However, that's not what the README specified for the project.
