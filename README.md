# RandomPasswordGen.EffYourSecurity
UPenn/Trilogy Computer Coding Bootcampt: 

Had/Have to create a random password generator using JavaScript right after my CPU died, lost all my notes, and couldn't participate in learning JavaScript the first time I was supposed to be learning it lol

I created a random password generator the wrong way my first go-around. You could press the "Generate" button, and it pumped out a password. However, that's not what the README specified for the project (please see images Annotation 2020-03-17 150752.png and Annotation 2020-03-17 150758.png, in that order). 

After working on this project for at least 15 hours, I finally gave up, having borrowed ideas from a number of tutorials online. Despite getting the password to actually show, it doesn't work the way that the README wants it to.
