# RandomPasswordGen.EffYourSecurity
UPenn/Trilogy Computer Coding Bootcampt: 

## Description
I created a random password generator that works utilizing javascript. The User enters a number of characters that the password will have; that value has to be between 8 and 128. 

The user then has to click on the types of characters to be used: uppercase and/or lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Finally, the user clicks on the "Generate Random Password" button at the bottom, and the password is generated next to a "clipboard" icon. Upon clicking that icon, an alert pops up to let the user know that the password has been copied to the clipboard so it can be pasted later. 

## Systems
This was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Contributions

My tutor, Meguel Chavez, and classmate, Erik Donovan assisted me greatly. Additionally, a number of online tutorials helped, especially WebDevSimplified github and youtube user name). Although I didn't end up following his code ideas very strictly, it helped a lot in terms of understanding various aspects of JavaScript.

## Future Adjustments/Implementations:

1. I can't seem to get the special characters to work. 
2. If the user wants a password that is very long, the result comes out extending beyond either side of the box that it should be contained in. Setting a max-width doesn't seem to do the trick either.
